### About my Game Engine
I started this project along time ago, i made several attempts and finally i started to work on.
So i recently started with a simple C# engine which turned into a supreme monstrous of super over engineer.

I back some steps, talk with some great people and i started the work again but from a fork of a deprecated fork
of Atomic Game Engine that i love.

I hope that one day i can use this project to made a good game and maybe work on a great company. So if you are an recruiter, send me a message.
